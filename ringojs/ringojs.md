# RingoJS

RingoJS is a JavaScript runtime written in Java based on Mozilla Rhino.

It adds a number of features to Rhino that make it suitable for real-world,
large-scale application development:

  * A fast, auto-reloading, and CommonJS-compliant module loader.
  * A rich set of modules covering I/O, logging, development tools
    and much more.
  * Scalable HTTP server based on the Jetty project.
  * Support for CommonJS packages to install or write additional software
    components.

# Building RingoJS

Ringo requires a recent version of [Java]. It uses Apache [Ant] as build tool
and [Ivy] for managing dependencies.

[Java]: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html
[Ant]: http://ant.apache.org/
[Ivy]: http://ant.apache.org/ivy/

If you have these installed, building Ringo is straightforward:

Check out Ringo using Git:

    git clone git://github.com/ringo/ringojs.git

Change to the ringojs directory and run the ant `update` task to fetch
dependencies:

    ant update

Then run the `jar` task to compile the code and build the jar file:

    ant jar

Run the `docs` task to build the documentation:

    ant docs

# Running RingoJS

It is recommended but not strictly required to add the ringojs bin directory to
your PATH environment variable. If you don't you'll have to type the full path
to the bin/ringo command in the examples below.

To start the Ringo shell, just run the ringo command without any arguments:

    ringo

To run a script simply pass it to ringo on the command line. For example,
to run the Ringo test suite:

    ringo test/all.js

Use the ringo-admin command to create a new web application or install
packages. To create a blank Ringo web app:

    ringo-admin create [appdir]

To install a package from a zip URL:

    ringo-admin install [packageurl]
